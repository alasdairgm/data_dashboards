# data_dashboards

This repository contains my RShiny dashboards which I made to practice presentation of data in an efficient and effective manner. It currently only contains my Lego data dashboard - displaying the ratings and price of sets in various themes, as well as an interactive world map of Legoland sites. This will be finished in time, with more dashboards to come.
